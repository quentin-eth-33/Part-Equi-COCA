Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\+Colouring\+Problem/\mbox{\hyperlink{ColouredGraph_8h}{Coloured\+Graph.\+h}} \\*Structure to a graph with colours coded as an integer. The colours themselves are not part of the structure, only the fact they are same or different matters }{\pageref{ColouredGraph_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\+Colouring\+Problem/\mbox{\hyperlink{ColouringReduction_8h}{Colouring\+Reduction.\+h}} \\*An implementation of the colouring problem seen in exercise session. Converts a graph g to a formula true if and only if it is possible to colour it with a fixed number of colours such that neighbouring node have different colours. Provides functions to generate the formula and the necessary variables, alongside function to decode a solution from a model of the formula }{\pageref{ColouringReduction_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\+Colouring\+Problem/\mbox{\hyperlink{ColouringResolution_8h}{Colouring\+Resolution.\+h}} \\*Algorithms to solve directly the Colouring problem }{\pageref{ColouringResolution_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\+Equitable\+Repartition\+Problem/\mbox{\hyperlink{RepartitionGraph_8h}{Repartition\+Graph.\+h}} \\*Structure to a graph with weights for several players and an assignation of each node to each player }{\pageref{RepartitionGraph_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\+Equitable\+Repartition\+Problem/\mbox{\hyperlink{RepartitionReduction_8h}{Repartition\+Reduction.\+h}} \\*An implementation of the Coca project for 2023 year. Converts a graph g with players assigning weights to its node to a formula true if and only if it exists a partition of nodes between player so that every player has a connected component which has a high enough score. Provides functions to generate the formula and the necessary variables, alongside function to decode a solution from a model of the formula }{\pageref{RepartitionReduction_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\+Equitable\+Repartition\+Problem/\mbox{\hyperlink{RepartitionResolution_8h}{Repartition\+Resolution.\+h}} \\*Algorithms to solve directly the Equitable Repartition problem }{\pageref{RepartitionResolution_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/main/\mbox{\hyperlink{Graph_8h}{Graph.\+h}} \\*Structure to store a graph statically, and to access to its informations easily. Includes source and target node informations, and colors }{\pageref{Graph_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/main/\mbox{\hyperlink{Parsing_8h}{Parsing.\+h}} \\*Contains function to convert graphviz files to the Graph\+List structure. Needs first to compile Lexer.\+lÂ and Parser.\+y with bison }{\pageref{Parsing_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/main/\mbox{\hyperlink{Z3Tools_8h}{Z3\+Tools.\+h}} \\*This file contains functions to easily and transparently manipulate the Z3 SMT solver as a SAT solver without delving too much in the documentation. Note that most functions ask for a Z3\+\_\+context. This is needed by Z3, but in this case, simply create a context at the beginning and pass it as an argument every time needed }{\pageref{Z3Tools_8h}}{}
